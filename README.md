The Lending Club project aims to develop a predictive model based on historical loan repayment data to forecast whether an individual will fully repay their loan, default on the loan, or have a delayed payment. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze patterns and factors that contribute to loan repayment behavior. **The project was created to showcase coding skills in PySpark, which is why the visual aspect has been kept to a minimum.**

## Introduction
In this data science project, I delve into the world of lending and finance by leveraging the extensive dataset provided by the Lending Club. Lending Club, as one of the most prominent peer-to-peer lending platforms, has amassed a vast repository of historical data regarding borrowers, their financial profiles, and the outcomes of their loan applications. This treasure trove of information presents us with a unique opportunity to harness the power of data science and machine learning to make informed credit risk assessments.

## Why This Project Matters
This project holds significant importance in the financial and lending domain, offering valuable insights and benefits to multiple stakeholders:
* Lending Institutions: Lenders can use the predictive model to make more informed and data-driven lending decisions. By accurately assessing the creditworthiness of applicants, they can minimize default risks and optimize their lending strategies. This leads to better portfolio performance and reduced financial losses.

* Borrowers: Borrowers benefit from fair and equitable access to credit opportunities. A robust credit assessment model ensures that deserving individuals are not unfairly denied loans based on inaccurate risk assessments. This promotes financial inclusion and access to capital for personal and business growth.

* Risk Management: The project contributes to effective risk management in the lending industry. By accurately classifying borrowers into repayment categories, it helps lenders proactively identify potential defaults and implement risk mitigation strategies.

* Financial Stability: Sound lending practices, driven by accurate risk assessment, contribute to the overall stability of the financial sector. Avoiding excessive defaults helps maintain the health of lending institutions, ultimately benefiting the broader economy.

* Decision Support: The predictive model can serve as a decision support tool for loan officers and underwriters. It provides them with data-driven insights to supplement their expertise, resulting in more consistent and reliable lending decisions.

* Automation and Efficiency: Automation of credit risk assessment through machine learning models streamlines the lending process. This can lead to quicker loan approvals and disbursements, enhancing the overall customer experience.

## Goal
My goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether an individual will repay a loan on time, make late payments, or default on it. The project's objective is to develop a classification model capable of classifying borrowers into these three categories, thereby assisting in credit risk assessment and lending decisions.
