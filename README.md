The Lending Club project aims to develop a predictive model based on historical loan repayment data to forecast whether an individual will fully repay their loan, default on the loan, or have a delayed payment. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze patterns and factors that contribute to loan repayment behavior. The project was created to showcase coding skills in PySpark, which is why the visual aspect has been kept to a minimum.
